Gavin Feng joined the City University of Hong Kong in 2017 as an assistant professor in statistics. His research interests include financial time series, empirical asset pricing, machine learning, and quantitative finance. One primary goal of his research is to develop statistical and machine learning methods for predicting asset returns in the cross-section and time series.

Gavin's research work has been invited to present at major academic conferences (AFA, CICF, Informs, and SoFie) and practitioner conferences (CQAsia, Wolfe Research, and INQUIRE Europe). His collaborative work "Taming the Factor Zoo" earned the 2018 AQR Insight Award and was accepted at the Journal of Finance. His other collaborative work "Deep Learning in Characteristics-Sorted Factor Models" earned the second prize of 2019 Crowell Prize, Unigestion Alternative Risk Premia Research Grant Award, and INQUIRE Europe Research Grant Award.
